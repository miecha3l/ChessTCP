Client-Server chess game via SFML::Network TCP socket connection

## Project introduction
This is my client-server chess game based on my own (kind off) chess engine. For now it is in early development. 
Communication model is based on TCP/IP socket connection implemented via SFML Network module.
This project is created as submission for my school programming contest "SCI++".

### To do:
-client application <br>
-client-server communication <br>

### What i learned
-how TCP/IP works in practice <br>
-how to design basic client-server communication <br>

### Installation
